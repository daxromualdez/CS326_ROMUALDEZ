TITLE: LibraryFlow: Community Book Exchange System

Problem Statement:
Small community libraries currently manage their inventory using physical notebooks or disorganized spreadsheets. This leads to lost books, no way for members to check availability from home, and difficulty for volunteers to track which books are most popular


Project Scope:
Defining what the project will and will not do prevents "scope creep."

In-Scope:

User authentication (Login/Sign-up for members).

Searchable database of available books.

Admin dashboard for librarians to add/remove titles.

A "Check-out/Check-in" system with due date notifications.

Out-of-Scope:

Processing late fee payments (Online transactions).

E-book reading capabilities (This is for physical books only).

Integration with national library databases.
