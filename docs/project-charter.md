# Project Charter

## Problem

The project aims to address inconsistent student project submission management and lack of a centralized system for tracking assignment status, grading progress, and feedback. Current manual processes lead to lost submissions, delayed grading, duplicated communication, and limited visibility for instructors and students.

## Goals

- Provide a reliable, centralized submission system to reduce lost or duplicated submissions.
- Enable instructors to track grading progress and provide timely feedback.
- Improve transparency for students on submission status and grading timelines.
- Reduce administrative overhead by automating basic notifications and record keeping.
- Deliver a minimally viable system within the current semester timeline.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Submission portal for assignment uploads.
- Instructor dashboard for viewing and grading submissions.
- Student view for submission status and received feedback.
- Basic notification emails for submission confirmation and grade posting.

**Out of scope:**
- Full LMS integration (can be considered in later phases).
- Advanced plagiarism detection beyond basic checks.
- Complex rubric/calibration workflows for graders (deferred to Phase 2).

## Stakeholders

- Project Sponsor: Course instructor — provides vision, acceptance criteria, and resources.
- Project Manager/Lead: (TBD) — coordinates development, testing, and deployment.
- Development Team: Developers and testers — build and verify the system.
- Students: Primary users submitting assignments and receiving feedback.
- Teaching Assistants / Graders: Users performing grading and entering feedback.
- IT / Operations: Provides hosting, backups, and production support.

## Success Criteria

- At least 95% of submissions successfully received and logged during pilot.
- Average time-to-grade reduced by 30% compared to manual process.
- Positive user feedback from instructors and students in pilot survey.
